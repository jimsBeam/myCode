A test repository for a few of my applications to review ...

	•	👋 Hi, I’m @jimsBeam
	•	👀 I’m interested in macOS Swift Programming ...
	•	🌱 I’m currently learning Swift programming ...
	•	💞️ I’m looking to review my current application which worked with Xcode 13.4 , but has a problem with Xcode 14.1 ...
	•	📫 How to reach me : jim.kitchen@shaw.ca


This small application creates and illustrates the following:

	1.	A calendar with a calendar imbedded within a POPOVER …
	2.	The POPOVER calendar can be configured to illustrate a calendar with and without a clock …
	3.	The POPOVER calendar allows you to select any date within the bounds of the displayed calendar …
	4.	The POPOVER calendar is activated when you choose a “year”, a “month”, or a “day” …
	5.	The POPOVER calendar will disappear when you reselect the main calendar window …
	6.	The application will only validate a calendar date up to and including today’s date …
	7.	The application will display “RED” text when the calendar date is beyond today’s date …

The test calendar application is an integral component within my main application, where the test application transfers the proper displayed date into the main application for database furtherance.
